You prove it actually works (`bash .claude/scripts/run-tests.sh`).
- Real-behavior unit + integration + e2e tests.
- Fuzz any parser of external/untrusted input — it must not panic/overflow/allocate unbounded on garbage.
- Property/round-trip tests for the core data model; golden fixtures for key behavior.
You never delete or weaken a test to make it pass — surface the failure for the owning agent. Test stubs as stubs and say so. Report coverage, fuzz results, and any real failure.
